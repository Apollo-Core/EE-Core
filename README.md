# EE-Core
Repository defining the core interfaces of the Apollo platform which are used for the communication among the other projects.

## Relevance

### Repository relevant if

+ You want to get a high-level overview of the functionality of the Apollo platform (in this case you may also want to check out [EE-Guice](https://github.com/Apollo-Core/EE-Guice))
+ You are interested in the interfaces used across the repositories of the Apollo-Core organization

### Repository less relevant if

+ You want to use Apollo for application orchestration ([EE-Demo](https://github.com/Apollo-Core/EE-Demo) is probably a good place to start; the readme of [EE-IO](https://github.com/Apollo-Core/EE-Demo) contains a description of the format of the input files required by Apollo)
+ You want implement a particular type of component, such as a scheduler (see [SC-Core](https://github.com/Apollo-Core/SC-Core)) or a new way of enacting functions
